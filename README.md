# jjs105/devcontainers

Home for both development and management of personal development containers and features.

## Development Environment

The repository itself uses a tweaked version of the Node.js based development container provided as a starter template
for container development. This container provides the following features:

* Use of Docker in Docker
* Installation of the official development container CLI tool(s)
* VS Code support for bash scripting (via extension)
* Installation of ESLint in VS Code (via extension)

# Repository Structure

The repository is split into 2 areas. The first containing the source code for the development containers themselves and
the second the source code for any individual features utilised by the development containers.
