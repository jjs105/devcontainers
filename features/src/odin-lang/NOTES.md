_Please note that compiling of the ODIN language is not yet supported by this
feature._

## Development Container Build Times

This feature, especially when setting the `compile` option to true, can add a
lot of time to any development container build.

For this reason, when using ODIN in ernest, the ODIN development container
template - which is yet to be implemented - should be used.
